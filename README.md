# Word Guessing Games

Here are various `python` scripts for analysing word guessing games such as
[Wordle]() and [Absurdle]().  The core is the file `puzzle.py` which provides
a class `Puzzle` that represents one of these guessing games.  The other files
are various programs I've written to analyse different aspects of the puzzles.
